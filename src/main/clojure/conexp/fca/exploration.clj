  "Performs attribute exploration on the given context(s).  Returns a hashmap of
  implications computed and the final context, stored with keys :implications
  and :context (in the case of complete counterexamples)
  or :possible-context/:certain-context (in the case of incomplete counterexamples),
  respectively.

  Arguments are passed as keyword arguments like so

    (explore-attributes
      :context ctx-1
      :handler my-handler)

    (explore-attributes
      :incomplete-counterexamples true
      :possible-context ctx-1
      :certain-context  ctx-2
      :handler          my-other-handler
      :background-knowledge #{})

  Either a value for :context or values for :possible-context and :certain-context must be
  given, but not both.  The second option is only possible if :incomplete-counterexamples
  is set to «true».

  Optional keyword arguments are:

  - :handler «fn»

    Interaction is accomplished via the given handler fn.  Depending on whether incomplete
    counterexamples are allowed or not, this handler is called with different arguments
    and is supposed to return different things:

    - if incomplete counterexamples are not allowed, «fn» is called (in this order) with
      the current working context, the set of known implications and the current
      implication to be asked to the expert.  It is supposed to return either «nil» (in
      which case the implication is accepted), or a sequence of counterexamples which are
      supposed to be of the form

        [g attributes]

      where «g» is the name of a new object and «attributes» is the set of attributes the
      new object should possess.

    - if incomplete counterexamples are allowed, «fn» is called with the context of
      possible incidences, the context of certain incidence, the set of known implications
      and the current implication to be asked to the expert.  It is supposed to return
      either «nil» (in which case the implication is accepted), or a sequence of
      counterexamples of the form

        [g positive-attributes negative-attributes],

      where «g» is a new object, «positive-attributes» is a sequence of attributes the new
      object has, and «negative-attributes» is a sequence of attributes the new object
      does not have.  Note that «positive-attributes» and «negative-attributes» must be
      disjoint.

    Note that it is the responsibility of the handler to ensure that the counterexample is
    correct.  If this is not the case, the exploration algorithm will just ask the same
    question in the next iteration again.

    It is possible to abort the exploration from within a handler.  For this, the handler
    just has to return :abort.  In this case, the current working context as well as the
    currently known implications are returned as if the exploration would have been
    finished in that iteration.

  - :background-knowledge «set of implications»

    background-knowledge denotes a set of implications used as background knowledge, which
    will be subtracted from the computed result.

  - :incomplete-counterexamples «true or false»

    Specifies whether incomplete counterexamples are allowed or not.  Default is false.
    Mandatory to be set to true if context is given via :possible-context
    and :certain-context.

  If you want to use automorphisms of the underlying context, you have to construct a
  special handler using the «make-handler» function. See the corresponding documentation
  of «make-handler»."
