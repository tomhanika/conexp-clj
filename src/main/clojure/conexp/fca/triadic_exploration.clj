;;; EXAMPLE
;;;;;;

;;; The following shows the situation of public transport at the train station Bf. Wilhelmshöhe with direction to the city center in Kassel.
;;; This example is part of the paper \"Triadic Exploration and Exploration with Multiple Experts\", see arXiv:2102.02654. 
;;; From Bf. Wilhelmshöhe you can travel by one of four bus lines (52, 55, 100 and 500), four tram lines (1, 3, 4 and 7), one night tram (N3) and one regional tram (RT5) to the city center.
;;; These are the objects of our context.
;;; The buses and trams leave the station at different times throughout each day of the week.
;;; The attributes of our context are the aggregated the leave-times, more specifically, we have split each day in five distinct time slots: early morning from 4:00 to 7:00, working hours from 7:00 to 19:00, evening from 19:00 to 21:00, late evening from 21:00 to 24:00 and night from 0:00 to 4:00.
;;; A bus or tram has a cross the formal context if there is at least one leave-time in the time slot.
;;; Furthermore, we have split the days of the week into Monday to Friday, Saturday and Sunday as conditions.
