This is the [conexp-clj](http://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj) community wiki.  It may serve
both as discussion board for conexp-clj in particular, and for FCA software in general.

## FCA Software Interoperatbility

There is a huge amount of FCA software out there (see
http://www.upriss.org.uk/fca/fcasoftware.html), which however performs poorly on the level
of interoperability.  To change this, this wiki is provided as discussion board on common
standards.
