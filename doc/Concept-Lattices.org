* Concept Lattices in ~conexp-clj~

~conexp-clj~ provides a wide range of functionality to compute concepts of
formal contexts, and to display the corresponding concept lattice.  Formal
concepts itself are represented as pairs (vectors) of sets, which corresponds to
the original mathematical definition.

** Computing Formal Concepts

To compute the concept of a formal context, we use the ~concepts~ function

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(concepts (diag-context 4))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
([#{0 1 3 2} #{}]
 [#{0} #{0}]
 [#{} #{0 1 3 2}]
 [#{1} #{1}]
 [#{3} #{3}]
 [#{2} #{2}])
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(concepts (adiag-context 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
([#{0 1 2} #{}]
 [#{1 2} #{0}]
 [#{2} #{0 1}]
 [#{} #{0 1 2}]
 [#{1} #{0 2}]
 [#{0 2} #{1}]
 [#{0} #{1 2}]
 [#{0 1} #{2}])
#+end_src

(recall that ~diag-context~ and ~adiag-context~ compute the nomial and
contra-nomial scale, respectively).  Intents and extends can be obtained from
combining ~concepts~ with ~map~ and ~first~ or ~second~, but there are also the
convenience functions ~extents~ and ~intents~ which can do the job

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(intents (diag-context 4))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
(#{} #{2} #{3} #{1} #{0} #{0 1 3 2})
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(map first (concepts (diag-context 4)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
(#{0 1 3 2} #{0} #{} #{1} #{3} #{2})
#+end_src

~conexp-clj~ uses Close-by-One to compute the concepts of a formal context, and
Next-Closure to compute the intents and extents as returned by ~intents~ and
~extents~, respectively.

All of ~concepts~, ~intents~, ~extents~ return lazy sequences. There is a parallel version available named ~parallel-concepts~, taking two additional arguments: The number of sequential iterations and the number of processors.

~concepts~ only returns a sequence of concepts of a formal context, but does not
represent their lattice structure.  For this, one can use ~concept-lattice~

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(concept-lattice (adiag-context 4))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
Lattice on 16 elements.
#+end_src

Interesting function which work on lattice structures are

- ~lattice-atoms~
- ~lattice-coatoms~
- ~lattice-doubly-irreducibles~
- ~lattice-inf-irreducibles~
- ~lattice-lower-neighbours~
- ~lattice-one~
- ~lattice-sup-irreducibles~
- ~lattice-upper-neighbours~
- ~lattice-zero~

Their purpose of these functions should be clear from their names, see the
corresponding documentation on further details.

** Linear extensions

A linear extension of a concept lattice is linear order of all elements such that the partial order of the lattice is not violated. Each lattice has at least one linear extension. The function ~minimals-plus~ allows to sample from the set of all linear extensions given the concept lattice and the number of samples.

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(minimals-plus (concept-lattice (adiag-context 2)) 2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
([[#{} #{0 1}] 
  [#{0} #{1}] 
  [#{1} #{0}] 
  [#{0 1} #{}]] 
 [[#{} #{0 1}] 
  [#{1} #{0}]  
  [#{0} #{1}]  
  [#{0 1} #{}]])
#+end_src

** Displaying Concept Lattices

It has to be noted that ~conexp-clj~ treats lattices as objects that are
different from their graphical representation.  To draw concep lattices (or even
arbitrary lattices), ~conexp-clj~ provides the notion of /layouts/.  Layouts are
essentially mappings from the elements of a lattice to position in ℝ², together
with the information which nodes are connected and where optional labels should
be positioned.  See the corresponding code for more information on this.

~conexp-clj~ provides some pre-defined layouts, and more can be defined as
needed.  While layouts itself are enabled by default, drawing these layouts must
be enabled explicitly via

#+begin_src clojure :results silent
(use 'conexp.gui.draw)
#+end_src

After this, the function ~draw-lattice~ can be used to display a lattice

#+begin_src clojure :results silent
(draw-lattice (concept-lattice (adiag-context 2)))
#+end_src

As a result, a window should open which shows the lattice.  In addition, some
functionality is provided that allows to further improve the image manually.

#+caption: Lattice Editor Example
[[./images/draw-lattice-01.png]]

The layout used by ~draw-lattice~ is defined in ~standard-layout~.  Other
layouts can be provided to ~draw-lattice~ as an additional argument

#+begin_src clojure :results silent
(draw-lattice (concept-lattice (adiag-context 2))
              :layout-fn inf-additive-layout)
#+end_src

The layout supports annotation by valuation functions. These can be
provided by the ~:value-fn~ argument. The following example annotates
the extent size.

#+begin_src clojure :results silent
(draw-lattice (concept-lattice (adiag-context 2))
              :layout-fn inf-additive-layout
              :value-fn (comp count first))
#+end_src

The evaluations defined via ~:value-fn~ are displayed after the labels are
switched on.

[[./images/draw-lattice-02.png]]

Other interesting functions are ~draw-layout~, which implements the drawing of
layouts, and ~draw-concept-lattice~, which draws the concept-lattice of a given
formal context. With ~draw-poset~ and ~draw-protoconcepts~, Ordered Sets and 
Protoconcepts can be drawn as well.
