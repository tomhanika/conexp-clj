* Setting up Emacs to Run Clojure Code

Some of the documentation for ~conexp-clj~ is written in [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]], a markup
language for Emacs.  In particular, Org-Mode provides a feature called [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][Source
Blocks]] that allow to embed executable code snippets into a document.  Some files
of the documentation of ~conexp-clj~ make use of this feature.

Before one can this embedded code, the following steps are necessary to be able
to run Clojure code in Emacs Org-Mode source blocks:

- Install cider from ~package.el~, directly from
  https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider, or by any other means.

- Run the following code when ~default-directory~ is within the ~conexp-clj~
  source repository.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent :exports code
(require 'ob-clojure)
(require 'cider)
(cider-jack-in-clj nil)
  #+end_src
