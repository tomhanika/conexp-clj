conexp-clj provides a simple interface to [sage](http://sagemath.org), a sophisticated and free computer algebra program (that can also do other math things than algebra).  You can find the interface code [here](https://github.com/exot/conexp-clj/tree/master/src/sage).

A sample implementation is running at the student representative's server of the faculty of math and sciences of the TU Dresden under http://sage.my-fsr.de.  A [short tutorial](https://sage.my-fsr.de/home/pub/0/) how to use this interface can also found there.
