* Getting Started with ~conexp-clj~

** Running conexp-clj from pre-compiled binaries

To run ~conexp-clj~, a Java Runtime Environment with version ≥ 1.11 is necessary.
The recommended way to use ~conexp-clj~ outside of development is to download a
[[https://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj/releases#:~:text=Assets][pre-compiled version]].  These are just usual Java jar files and can be used like
this:

#+begin_src sh :eval never
java -jar conexp-clj-2.5.0-standalone-openjdk-11.jar
#+end_src

This will get you a prompt for ~conexp-clj~ much like

#+begin_src text
conexp.analysis=>
#+end_src

You can now use all the power of formal concept analysis from ~conexp-clj~, and
also everything Clojure provides.  For example, you can compute the value of the
expression ~1 + 1~ as

#+begin_src text
conexp.analysis=> (+ 1 1)
2
#+end_src

(where you do not type the ~conexp.main=>~ and the 2 is the result of the
evaluation.

You may also start the (rudimentary) graphical user interface (GUI) by appending `-g` 

#+begin_src sh :eval never 
java -jar conexp-clj-2.5.0-standalone-openjdk-11.jar -g
#+end_src


** Running conexp-clj directly from source

It is also possible to get command line access for ~conexp-clj~ directly from
its source.  You usually want to do that while developing new features for
~conexp-clj~, or when integrating ~conexp-clj~ into IDEs.  Getting this to work
requires the following two (easy) steps:

1. Get the [[http://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj][source code]] of ~conexp-clj~
2. Get [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]], the build tool used by ~conexp-clj~

Then, to run ~conexp-clj~ directly from source, switch in the source directory of ~conexp-clj~ and run

#+begin_src sh :eval never
lein deps
#+end_src

This will download any missing jar files needed for ~conexp-clj~ to run.  To
quickly obtain a repl just issue

#+begin_src sh :eval never
lein repl
#+end_src

This will give you a command prompt as in the previous case.

If you want a more sophisticated repl, you may try [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][Emacs Cider]].

You can start the graphical user interface (GUI) via 

#+begin_src sh :eval never
lein run -g
#+end_src

** Running conexp-clj via nix

Using the [[https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/][nix]] package manager, you can directly run ~conexp-clj~ without
installing it:

#+begin_src shell :eval never
nix run github:tomhanika/conexp-clj
#+end_src

Instead of running it directly, you can also just start a shell that
has ~conexp-clj~ in its path (again without installing it):

#+begin_src shell :eval never
nix shell github:tomhanika/conexp-clj
#+end_src

We also provide ~conexp-clj~ as a *package* in the [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][nix flake]], so you can
add it to, e.g., a system configuration or use it from within a
[[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/][home-manager]] configuration. First, add ~conexp-clj~ as a flake input:

#+begin_src nix :eval never
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "…";
    conexp-clj = {
      url = "github:tomhanika/conexp-clj";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Then, you can, e.g., add ~conexp-clj~ to a system configuration to have
it installed permanently, where ~system~ is the appropriate system
type, e.g., ~x86_64-linux~.

#+begin_src nix :eval never
  environment.systemPackages = [ conexp-clj.packages."system".conexp-clj ];
#+end_src

There is also an *overlay* than can be applied to ~nixpkgs~:

#+begin_src nix :eval never
  nixpkgs.overlays = [ conexp-clj.overlays.default ];
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.conexp-clj ];
#+end_src

Lastly, for development on ~conexp-clj~, the ~nix~ flake provides a
*devshell* that has ~leiningen~ and ~clojure-lsp~ in its path. From the
source directory, run:

#+begin_src shell :eval never
nix develop
#+end_src

** Loading Code from a File

Typing in long sequences of commands is tedious, and ~conexp-clj~ inherits from
Clojure the possibility to compile and run complex programs.  Everything you can
type into the prompt can also be written into a file, say ~file.clj~.  To run
(and compile) this file, just type do

#+begin_src clojure :eval never
(load-file "file.clj")
#+end_src

** Concerning the Graphical User Interface

As indicated above, tt is also possible to use ~conexp-clj~'s incomplete GUI fragment. But please note that the GUI is not only (inherently) limited in its
functionality, but also quite (not to say: really) buggy.

** Online Documentation (No Network Required!)

For general help on a function ~f~, you can use the clojure function ~doc~.  For
example, to see the documentation of ~make-context~, just run

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(doc make-context)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
-------------------------
conexp.fca.contexts/make-context
([objects attributes incidence])
  Standard constructor for contexts. Takes a sequence of objects,
  a sequence of attributes and either a set of pairs or function of two arguments being
  true iff its arguments are incident. Note that the object and attribute sequences are
  converted to sets and therefore have to not contain any duplicate elements. If the
  incidence relation is given as a sequence, it is automatically restricted to the
  cartesian product of the object an the attribute set.

#+end_src

For finding functions you may find useful, you can use ~find-doc~.  Note that
depending on the input, the returned list may be quite long.

#+begin_src clojure :exports both
(find-doc "canonical-base")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src text
-------------------------
conexp.fca.implications/approx-canonical-base
([ctx ε δ])
  Compute a set L of implications that is an approximation to the canonical
  base of the formal context `ctx'.  More precisely, if H is the canonical base
  of ctx, then

    |Mod(L) Δ Mod(H)|/2^{|M|} ≤ ε

  with probability at least 1-δ.  The computation is done in polynomial time
  with respect to |M|, |L|, 1/ε, and 1/δ. 
-------------------------
conexp.fca.implications/canonical-base
([ctx] [ctx background-knowledge] [ctx background-knowledge predicate])
  Returns the canonical base of given context, as a lazy sequence.  Uses
  «background-knowledge» as starting set of implications, which will not appear
  in the result.  If «predicate» is given (a function), computes only those
  implications from the canonical base whose premise satisfy this predicate,
  i.e. «predicate» returns true on these premises.  Note that «predicate» has to
  satisfy the same conditions as the predicate to «next-closed-set-in-family».
-------------------------
conexp.fca.implications/canonical-base-from-base
([implications])
  For a given set of implications returns its stem-base.
-------------------------
conexp.fca.implications/canonical-base-from-clop
([clop base] [clop base background-knowledge] [clop base background-knowledge predicate])
  Given a closure operator «clop» on the set «base», computes its canonical base,
   optionally using the set «background-knowledge» of implications on «base-set»
  as background knowledge.  The result will be a lazy sequence.  If «predicate»
  is given as third argument, computes only those implications whose premise
  satisfy this predicate.  Note that «predicate» has to satisfy the same
  conditions as the one of «next-closed-set-in-family».
-------------------------
conexp.fca.implications/parallel-canonical-base
([ctx] [ctx background-knowledge])
  Computes the canonical base of the given formal context.
  Background knowledge can be provided as a set of implications on the attribute
  set of the given context.  Computation is eager and is done in parallel.
-------------------------
conexp.fca.implications/parallel-canonical-base-from-clop
([clop base] [clop base background-knowledge])
  Computes the canonical base of the given closure operator in parallel.
  Accepts the same parameters as «canonical-base-from-clop», except for the
  predicate.
