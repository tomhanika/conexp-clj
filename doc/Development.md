## Compilation Instructions for conexp-clj

*TODO*: This is obsolete!

To create a standalone zip on your own, just run `make` in the top source
directory. This will (should) do everything to create a zip archive containing a
compiled version of conexp-clj. You can also run this compiled version directly
by invoking `./conexp-clj/bin/conexp-clj` (after unpacking the .zip file.)
